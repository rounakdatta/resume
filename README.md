## Source code for my resume

I like documenting my career in public, and I cannot lie. `resume.cls` is the design of this template originally crafted by Trey Henner. Some modifications (following the license) have been made by me. `resume.tex` is my instance of the template which is supposed to contain only data elements.

While I discoverd this template via Overleaf, I now edit my resume on Emacs (which has a fantastic side-panel-preview render like Overleaf) and of course the history is being tracked on this git repository. [LatexOnline](https://latexonline.cc) is a free web service to render a LaTeX source code like this and I use that to generate a JIT preview.
