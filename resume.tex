\begin{rSection}{Experience}

  \begin{rSubsection}{\href{https://tech.hotstar.com/}{Disney+ Hotstar}}{Bengaluru, India}{Software Development Engineer II (Data Platform, Growth Engineering)}{Jul `20 - Present}
    \item Designed \& implemented a \textbf{streaming data quality framework} which validates incoming events at the ingestion layer. Also built its self-serve tooling (visual schema editor) and CLI complements. Also contributed patches to our ETL data quality suite.
    \item Migrated various critical platform ETLs from \textbf{Oozie to Airflow}; wrote Airflow operators which helped in abstraction and reusability of commonly-used workflows across org. Addressed wide range of production incidents as on-call engineer - from Hive/Spark to Kafka to microservices.
    \item Took lead in implementing our re-architected \textbf{Change-Data-Capture framework} (CDC) to improve parallelization, configurability, reliability and data-freshness. Also designed a declarative GitOps pipeline to onboard new CDC jobs real fast.
    \item Led the foundational efforts in \textbf{Growth Engineering} team to enable Data Platform, Subscriptions \& Payments services to new markets in South-East Asia; introduced major refactors to the subscriptions partnership framework which cut down new onboarding times by over 80\%. Also initiated the design work of \textit{async APIs} for the same.
    \item Designed and architected a fault-tolerant backend for supporting \textbf{Android in-app-payments} for subscriptions.
    \item Drove the development and release of the highly extensible framework behind \textbf{Disney+ Worldwide Pre-Launch \& Landing pages}.\\
    \faicon{line-chart} \textit{Bringing my A-game to the table and investing in each others' growth has been my top priority!}

  \begin{rSubsection}{}{}{Intern (Data Platform)}{June `19 - Jul `19, Jan `20 - Jun `20}
    \item Designed and developed a \textbf{storage-layer resource optimization} framework, which when benchmarked achieved xx\% improvements in query times and x\% reductions in data lake storage costs.
    \item Crafted a batch \textbf{data metrics collection} job, which helped in increased visibility and static monitoring of data sanity.\\
    \faicon{rocket} \textit{The leadership was impressed with my performance and collaboration and I was offered a PPO!}
  \end{rSubsection}

  \begin{rSubsection}{\href{https://www.guvi.in/}{Guvi Geek Networks}}{Chennai, India}{Intern}{Mar `18 - Jul `18, Dec `18}
    \item Responsible for collaborating on Guvi 2.0 platform, an adaptive \textbf{performance-based learning platform}.
    \item Developed an in-house \textbf{resume parsing} system with sub-second query latency for 20K+ data; our software supports a diverse range of resume formats.
    \item Designed and developed an English \textbf{spelling \& grammatical corrector}; achieved around 73\% accuracy when benchmarked with Grammarly \& human proofreading.\\
    \faicon{bolt} \textit{We (two of us interns) architected as well implemented the latter projects' MVP in tight two months!}
